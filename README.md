# VSCode GraphQL Import

A VSCode extension to improve the experience of using the #import directive in GraphQL files.

## TODO

- [ ] Provide completions for graphql imports as you are typing
- [ ] Provide red squiggles if you've messed up an import declaration (e.g. you put a space between the hash and import, or are using single quotes when you should use double)
- [ ] Provide red squiggles if the file you're importing can't be found
